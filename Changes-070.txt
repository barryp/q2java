CHANGES from v0.6.8 to v0.7.0

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file will just list changes in the core packages 
(q2java, q2jgame, baseq2, menno.ctf). Add-ons will have to list their own changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DLL CHANGES ===============================================================

    Heavily reworked so that a single Win32 DLL supports both JDK 1.1 and 1.2,
    and automatically locates the DLL, so no PATH changes are required under
    Windows.  Also sort of supports the new Microsoft VM that has JNI,
    although it's buggy and crashes quite quickly. 
    
    Added support for reading a Java properties file at startup, allowing
    the user to specify the exact JavaVM DLL to use, security settings, 
    debug log settings, and arbitrary System properties and JDK 1.2 
    VM options.

    Support for Linux - finally.  Although there may be problems with
    multiplayer mode..since the JVM may be conflicting with Q2's network
    code.

q2java.Engine

    Added:   Constants MAX_GENERAL, CS_AIRACCEL, CS_MAXCLIENTS, CS_GENERAL,
             several TE_ values, from the 3.20 sourcecode
            
             getVWepIndex() - moved from q2jgame.Game

q2java.GameListener

    Changed: PlayerConnect() no longer takes boolean parameter
    
             WriteGame() added boolean parameter
             
q2java.NativeEntity

             RDF_IRGOGGLES, several RF_ constants, STAT_CHASE,
             STAT_SPECTATOR, from the 3.20 sourcecode          
             
             getPlayerBlend() and getPlayerFOV() for the sake of completeness   
             
q2java.PlayerListener

    Changed: playerBegin() no longer takes boolean parameter
    
q2java.Q2JavaSecurityManager

    Changed: constructor now canonicalizes the sandbox path before storing it.                 
    
q2jgame.Game

    Changed: init method no longers supports the CVar "q2jgame_packages",
             people should have switched to "q2jgame_modules" a long time
             ago.
             
             init method also looks for module names in the System properties
             "q2java.module.1", "q2java.module.2", etc..
             
    Removed: getVWepIndex() - was moved to q2java.Engine    
                          
menno.ctf.GenericFlag
menno.ctftech.GenericTech
    Added:   becomeExplosion() to override baseq2.GameObject.becomeExplosion()
             to prevent flags and techs from exploding when in the way 
             of a GenericPusher.
             
baseq2.Door

    Added:   block() - called when door is blocked by something                          
    
baseq2.GameObject

    Added:   becomeExplosion() - a way for the game to get rid of objects
             in the way of doors, plats, and such
             
baseq2.GenericPusher

    Added:   block() - called when GenericPusher is blocked by something
    
    Changed: reworked to fix the longtime bug of pushing things 
             out of the world.
             
baseq2.PlatformTrigger

    Changed: touch() method now only triggers plat when it's in the lowered
             position..making behavior more like the C game             
             
baseq2.Player

    Changed: spawn() resets player FOV to their preferred value (it's
             set to 90 degrees at intermission)
             
baseq2.spawn.func_door_secret
baseq2.spawn.func_rotating
baseq2.spawn.func_train

    Added:   block() method called when object is blocked
    
baseq2.spawn.func_plat

    Added:   block() method called when plat is blocked
        
             isLowered() method lets baseq2.PlatformTrigger tell
             if it should operate or not
