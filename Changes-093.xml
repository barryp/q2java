    <fix author="Leigh" mail="ldodds@ingenta.com">
      cmd_say() fixed to catch case of empty-string being passed 
      as an arg - so a NullPointerException isn't thrown.  
    </fix>
    <change author="Barry" mail="barryp@planetquake.com">
      getMaxAmmoCount() made public - so that property can be
      manipulated by external objects like item_pack

      setAmmoCount() methods make sure that the ammo count

      setMaxAmmoCount() - to go along with getMaxAmmoCount()

  <class name="q2java.baseq2.spawn.item_pack">
    <addition author="Barry" mail="barryp@planetquake.com">
      New class, to implement ammo backpacks that increase a player's
      capacity, and gives a quick ammo-refill.
    </addition>
  </class>
  
  <class name="q2java.core.BasicServerCommands">
    <addition author="Leigh" mail="ldodds@ingenta.com">
      Several of the basic server commands were removed from the Game class
      and moved into this new class.
    </addition>
  </class>
  
  <class name="q2java.core.DefaultClassFactory">
    <change author="Leigh" mail="ldodds@ingenta.com">
      This class has been reworked to just handle locating classes, and no longer
      involves itself with gamelet management. 
    </change>
  </class>
  
  <class name="q2java.core.Game">
    <change author="Leigh" mail="ldodds@ingenta.com">

    <addition author="Barry" mail="barryp@planetquake.com">
      A new Game property, the "packagePath" - manipulated with addPackagePath() and 
      removePackagePath() methods has been added. Basically the Game class
      will keep track of a list of package names, and ClassFactory objects will refer
      to it when trying to figure out the full Java classnames of partially specified
      classes (such as when it needs to figure out that "weapon_rocket" is implemented
      by "q2java.baseq2.spawn.weapon_rocket").  
    </addition>
  </class>
  
  <class name="q2java.core.GameletManager">
    <addition author="Leigh" mail="ldodds@ingenta.com">
      Gamelet management was been taken out of the Game and DefaultClassFactory classes
      and moved here.  The Game class has setGameletManager() and getGameletManager() 
      methods to access the Game's current GameletManager object.
    </addition>
  </class>
  
  <class name="q2java.core.GameUtil">
    <addition author="Barry" mail="barryp@planetquake.com">
      Versions of getAngle3f(), getPoint3f(), and getSpawnArg() to work with DOM elements
      instead of old-fashioned arrays of strings.
    </addition>
    
    <addition author="Barry" mail="barryp@planetquake.com">
      New versions of randomInt() to more conveniently generate random numbers on the ranges
      0..n-1, given a value n, or in the range x..y given x and y.
    </addition>    
  </class>
