    <addition author="Barry" mail="barryp@planetquake.com">
      A new Game property, the "packagePath" - manipulated with addPackagePath() and 
      removePackagePath() methods has been added. Basically the Game class
      will keep track of a list of package names, and ClassFactory objects will refer
      to it when trying to figure out the full Java classnames of partially specified
      classes (such as when it needs to figure out that "weapon_rocket" is implemented
      by "q2java.baseq2.spawn.weapon_rocket").  
    </addition>

  <class name="q2java.core.GameletManager">
    <addition author="Leigh" mail="ldodds@ingenta.com">
      Gamelet management was been taken out of the Game and DefaultClassFactory classes
      and moved here.  The Game class has setGameletManager() and getGameletManager() 
      methods to access the Game's current GameletManager object.
