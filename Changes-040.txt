CHANGES from v0.3 to v0.4

q2java.Engine

    Added:

    	public final static int TE_BFG_LASER			= 23;
    	public final static int TE_GRAPPLE_CABLE		= 24;
    	public final static int TE_WELDING_SPARKS		= 25;
    	public final static int TE_PLASMATRAIL			= 26;
    	public final static int TE_GREENBLOOD			= 27;

        boolean isPlayer(); // to check whether an entity is
                            // one of the special ones used for players

        void setPlayerBlend(Color4f); 

    Changed:

        getMins(), getAbsMins(), getMaxs(), getAbsMaxs() now return Point3f

        getSize() now returns Vector3f

q2java.Q2JavaSecurityManager

    Changed:

        Now allows read-access to files ending with "\lib\security\java.security"
        (directory separators appropriate to the OS) - required for 
        serialization support


q2jgame.Game

    Added:
        GameModule - an abstract class which add-on packages must subclass.  The class
        contains a default svcmd_help() and unload() methods.  A no-arg constructor
        is called when a package is loaded, so it can initialize itself.    


        LoadedPackage - a class to track loaded packages.  probably needs more work
        with get/set accessor functions.

    Changed:

        Now supports aliases for loaded packages, svcmds can now be called with
        "sv <alias>:<cmd>"  Help for packages is now "sv <alias>:help"

        Just typing "sv" by itself now brings up the help screen

barryp.persist

    New add-on package to demonstrate serializing the player object.  Requires
    security level 0 or 1.  When this module is loaded, a disconnecting player's 
    object is stored in the sandbox directory under his name.  When connecting, the 
    game will first look in the sandbox directory for a stored object.  If it finds one, 
    the player is restored with his saved weapons and ammo.  If not, a fresh player
    object is created.

baseq2.GenericWeapon

    Changed:
        private fields/methods now protected

        Stores weapon viewmodel as string instead of int - for serialization

        out if a quad / ctf strength-rune is in effect.  Normally set to 1.0, a
        quad could set this to 4.0.

        clearSettings() method...to reset a player's settings to a freshly spawned state.
                
        cmd_help() and cmd_score() methods from Badger
