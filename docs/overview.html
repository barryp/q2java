<h1>Q2Java Overview</h1>
This document will attempt to give a broad overview of Q2Java, how in fits in 
with Quake2, and why you would want to use Java with Quake2. 
<h2>What is Q2Java? </h2>
<p>When people first hear of Q2Java, they often think we've tried to completely 
  rewrite Quake2 in Java - but that's not the case. Q2Java runs on top of the 
  Quake2 executable (provided by id Software), just like a normal Q2 mod. </p>
<p>There's no need to worry about how Java could possibly be fast enough to handle 
  rendering scenes as fast as C code can - because it doesn't even try. All that 
  really speed-sensitive stuff is still handled by the Quake2 executable. The 
  time spent executing the code in game mods (any game mod - not just Q2Java) 
  is actually pretty small. </p>
<p>The diagram below shows how Q2Java stacks up against traditional Q2 mods (using 
  the Win32 platform for the sake of discussion).</p>

<p>A traditional mod is written in C and compiled into a single file named <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">gamex86.dll</font>. 
  The Quake2 executable calls on this DLL to handle the actual running of the 
  game. Various mods such as CTF and RocketArena2 are distributed as separate 
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">gamex86.dll</font> files, and are fairly 
  large - usually 600kB or more of sourcecode.</p>
<p>Q2Java also has a <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">gamex86.dll</font>, 
  written in C just like a traditional mod, but it's quite a bit smaller (only 
  about 155kB of sourcecode). Its main job is to invoke a Java Virtual Machine 
  (JVM) and act as an intermediary between the Quake2 executable and the Java 
  code. Most of the things handled by a normal mod in C have been rewritten in 
  Java, and are executed by the JVM.</p>
<p>While the Q2Java <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">gamex86.dll</font> 
  sourcecode is available, there should be no real need to change it, since it 
  does so little. All the interesting things happen up in the Java code, and that's 
  where Q2Java mod authors will be doing their coding. </p>
<h2>Q2Java on various platforms</h2>
<p>Currently, Q2Java runs on 3 platforms with 5 different JVMs. The table below 
  shows the various component combinations. The important thing to note about 
  Q2Java is that its Java Game Code covers all the supported platforms, without 
  even having to be recompiled.</p>

<p>Porting Q2Java to other platforms that have an implementation of Quake2 and 
  a JVM should just be a matter of altering and recompiling the gamex86.dll - 
  all the Java code should theoretically run unchanged.</p>
<h2>Why Java</h2>
<p>Writing game code in Java has several advantages over coding in C. Q2Java tries 
  to make good use of Java features such as: <br>
  &nbsp;

  <tr> 
    <td bgcolor="#333333"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Object-orientation</font></b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td bgcolor="#5C6446">
      <p>Various Quake II entities are represented by corresponding Java classes.&nbsp; 
        For example, there is a class that represents Players, a separate class 
        for each kind of weapon, each kind of ammo box, doors, platforms, trains, 
        and so on. </p>
      <p>This makes game code quite a bit easier to maintain, unlike the C sourcecode 
        which is all jumbled together, and one single structure, the edict_t, 
        is used to represent every single thing that can possibly show up in a 
        game - with all kinds of fields that are only used in some cases, or used 
        for multiple purposes depending on what kind of item it's representing.

  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td bgcolor="#5C6446">Classes with similar functions are grouped together, 
      and their common methods are stored in a superclass.&nbsp; For example: 
      there's a GenericWeapon class which contains fields and methods common to 
      all weapons, and subclasses such as Shotgun and RocketLauncher that implement 
      specific weapon behaviors.</td>

      of Data and Methods</font></b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td bgcolor="#5C6446">Classes can have fields and methods declared private 
      or protected, so that code outside the class itself or its descendants can't 
      accidentally muck with the object's state.&nbsp; For example, there is a 
      <tt>func_door</tt> class, with the public methods <tt>open()</tt> and <tt>close()</tt>,&nbsp; 
      but the class hides the fields and methods it uses to implement the actual 
      mechanics of opening and closing doors.</td>

  <tr> 
    <td bgcolor="#333333"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Event Delegation</font></b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td bgcolor="#5C6446">
      <p>Event Delegation is actually more of a programming style than a language 
        feature, but it's very common in Java GUI apps, and is made practical 
        by the language's <i>interface</i> feature. Basically, with event delegation, 
        a Java object that implements a <i>listener</i> interface can be registered 
        with an event-source to be called when some interesting event occurs. 
        In typical GUI apps, events are things like mouseclicks, keyboard presses, 
        window-resizings, etc. </p>
      <p>With Q2Java, we've taken the same idea and applied it to events such 
        as: new levels starting, players connecting, players picking something 
        up, players being injured, etc. Objects that want to be called when a 
        particular type of event occurs simply have to implement a particular 
        interface, and register themselves with the source of that kind of event.

  <tr> 
    <td bgcolor="#333333"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dynamic 
      Linking</font></b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td bgcolor="#5C6446">
      <p>Dynamic Linking allows arbitrary Java classes to be loaded into memory 
        at run-time (unlike traditional C mods which are statically-linked - meaning 
        all the code is joined together at compile-time - basically set in stone). 
      </p>
      <p>Q2Java uses dynamic linking to load <i>gamelets</i>, which are modules 
        of Java code that can exist independently of each other to some degree 
        - that implement some game feature. When a gamelet is loaded, it usually 
        hooks itself into the rest of the game through the event-delegation feature 
        mentioned above, so that it's called when events that it's interested 
        in occur. Since the linking is dynamic, new gamelets can be brought into 
        the system while a game is running - adding new features to a game without 
        requiring a recompile of the main game code.</p>
      <p>Dynamic Linking is also used in spawning entities when a map is loaded.&nbsp; 
        When the Q2Java Game class's spawnEntities() method is called, one of 
        the parameters is a very large string describing all the entities that 
        should be placed on the map.&nbsp; The entity string is parsed, and for 
        each entity, the Q2Java game appends the name of the entity class, such 
        as <tt>item_armor_combat</tt>, or <tt>weapon_chaingun</tt> to a fixed 
        package name such as <tt>q2java.baseq2.spawn </tt>to come up with a Java 
        classname such as <tt>q2java.baseq2.spawn.weapon_chaingun</tt>.&nbsp; 
        The Q2Java game then tries to locate an actual class with that name, and 
        if it can find it, it creates and instance of it, passing the other entity 
        string parameters as arguments to the class's constructor. </p>
      <p>The advantage to this feature is that you can add new entity classes 
        to a game <i>without having to modify and&nbsp; recompile the original 
        game code</i>.&nbsp; If you wanted to create a map and stick in a new 
        kind of entity called, say, <tt>item_armor_facemask</tt>, you could create 
        a corresponding Java class named <tt>q2java.baseq2.spawn.item_armor_facemask</tt>, 
        and when you ran the game and loaded the map, you new type of item would 
        be spawned along with everything else.
