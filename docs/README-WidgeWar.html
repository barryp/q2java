<h1>WidgetWars</h1>
<p><i>(a working title) </i></p>
<h2>Server QuickStart</h2>
<p>WidgetWars is a team game that uses CTF maps and resources. To make those resources 
  accessible to your server, you'll have to copy or move the CTF .pak file from 
  your <code>quake2\ctf</code> directory to your <code>quake2\baseq2</code> directory 
  (changing the number of the pak file if there's already a .pak file in your 
  baseq2 directory with the same number). </p>
<p>Start the game with a command line such as:</p>
<p> <code>q2java +map q2ctf1 +set q2java_startup widgetwar.startup.sample</code></p>
<p>Add <code>+set dedicated 1</code> for a dedicated server. Edit the widgetwar.startup.sample 
  file to customize the game. If you call your startup file just <code>q2java.startup</code>, 
  you can get by with the shorter command-line:</p>
<p><code>q2java +map q2ctf1</code></p>
<h2>Client QuickStart</h2>
<h3>Game Resources</h3>
<p>WidgetWars is a team game that uses CTF maps and resources. To make those resources 
  accessible in your client, you'll have to copy or move the CTF .pak file from 
  your <code>quake2\ctf</code> directory to your <code>quake2\baseq2</code> directory 
  (changing the number of the pak file if there's already a .pak file in your 
  baseq2 directory with the same number). </p>
<p>There are also some screen icons you need to download from the server the first 
  time you play the game. You can do this by starting the game with this command:</p>
<p><code>quake2 +set allow_downloads 1 +connect www.xxx.yyy.zzz</code></p>
<p>Where <code>www.xxx.yyy.zzz</code> is the IP address of the WidgetWar server. 
  Once the icons are downloaded to your disk, you don't need to do the allow_downloads 
  bit anymore, and can start q2 without that extra <code>+set allow_downloads 
  1</code> parameter. </p>
<h3>Commands</h3>
<p>The commands unique to this game are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>widget</li>
  <li>body</li>
  <li>control</li>
  <li>payload</li>
  <li>deploy</li>
  <li>describe</li>
</ul>
<p>The first five will be frequently used, so you'll probably want to bind them 
  to keys. I've been using this binding:</p>
<pre><code>bind z widget
</code><code>bind x body
</code><code>bind c control
</code><code>bind v payload
</code><code>bind b deploy</code></pre>
<p>You can type those lines in your console, or place them in a file named <code>quake2\q2java\autoexec.cfg</code> 
  if you don't want to type them every time you connect.</p>
<p>I'll get into what they do later in this document.</p>
<h2>Playing the Game</h2>
<h3>The Objective</h3>
<p>The main objective in this game, is to steal enemy technology, and prevent 
  the enemy team from stealing your technology. Technology is represented by CDs 
  (compact-disks) that can be found where flags normally appear in CTF - or by 
  DataCards occasionally dropped by dying players. </p>
<p>If you bring a CD or DataCard back to your base (where the CTF flags would 
  appear), you'll capture some fraction of an enemy technology. The amount captured 
  on a CD depends on how long it took you to make the capture. The amount captured 
  on a Datacard is fixed, but if a player dies while carrying an enemy datacard, 
  that card is lost (unlike a CD which can be picked up by a teammate and carried 
  on to the base)</p>
<p>Once a team has captured 100% of a technology, the team can start using that 
  technology.</p>
<p>The game also keeps score based on percentage of technologies captured. If 
  a team doesn't have any more technology to steal, then any further captures 
  are basically just for the points - which show up on the lower right of the 
  HUD - one point for each percent of technology captured.</p>
<h3>Technologies</h3>
<p>What's a technology, and why would you want to capture one? Unlike a CTF flag 
  which is just a symbolic token worth points on a scoreboard, a technology is 
  actually useful. A technology is the knowledge of how to build a widget component. 
  The more technologies a team has, the greater the variety of items team members 
  can build. </p>
<p>When a level first starts, both teams are given some common technologies, and 
  a few unique ones. As the level progresses, every 5 minutes or so teams are 
  given new technologies - so there are new things to steal, and the game just 
  gets more and more intense.</p>
<h3>Widgets</h3>
<p>A widget is an item you build and deploy into the world, made up of a combination 
  of various components. Each component is an instance of a particular technology. 
  There are three types of technologies/components:</p>
<p><b><i>Body</i></b>: responsible for the appearance and movement of the widget 
  in the world. For example, a simple box that sits on the ground, or a guided 
  missile.</p>
<p><b><i>Control</i></b>: (optional) gives some direction to the body and/or payload. 
  For example, one control unit might automatically target enemy players, another 
  might target enemy widgets.</p>
<p><b><i>Payload</i></b>: (optional) hopefully does something useful - like kill 
  enemy players. For example, a cluster bomb that might throw out a shower of 
  grenades, or a comm jammer that screws up enemy team communications.</p>
<p>To create a widget, you select a body using the <code>body</code> command (or 
  by tapping whatever key you've bound that command to), select a control with 
  the <code>control</code> command, and a payload with the <code>payload</code> 
  command. The lower-left corner of the HUD (Heads Up Display) shows you current 
  selection of components. Keep tapping the keys until you come up with the combination 
  you want, and then hit the <code>deploy</code> key (which I bound to &quot;<code>b</code>&quot; 
  in my example bindings at the top of this doc).</p>
<p>On executing the <code>deploy</code> command, your widget should appear in 
  front of you. What it does after that depends on the particular combination 
  of components you selected (a box will probably just sit there, while a missile 
  will probably launch immediately). On your HUD, above the component display, 
  you'll see a row of box-indicators, one for each widget slot. The &quot;current&quot; 
  widget is indicated by a yellow highlight, and an green-light indicates this 
  widget is active. </p>
<p>If you want to create another widget, you'll have to select another widget-slot, 
  use the <code>widget</code> command to rotate through the various slots, until 
  you find one that's empty (has no green light). </p>
<p>If you want to destroy a widget to free up a slot, use the <code>widget</code> 
  command to rotate through the slots until you come to the one you want to get 
  rid of, and then tap the <code>deploy</code> key twice (the first time you tap 
  it you'll hear a warning noise).</p>
<p>The last command you might want to know about is <code>describe</code> - which 
  prints on the console a short description of what the currently selected technologies 
  do. </p>
<h3>Energy</h3>
<p>Energy is the main resource in this game. Instead of individual types of ammo, 
  all the weapons use energy cells. Energy is also consumed when you build widgets 
  and when you jump (bunny-hoppers beware). </p>
<p>Where does energy come from? Your battle suit naturally generates energy, more 
  as you're standing still, less as you're running. You can use the <code>drop 
  cells</code> command to give energy to other players, and dying players will 
  sometimes drop energy cells.</p>
<p>There will also be energy-related technologies in the game, such as the &quot;<code>energy 
  siphon</code>&quot; payload which steals energy from enemy players.</p>
<h3>Health</h3>
<p>Health is similar to Energy in that your suit will automatically heal you, 
  but only if you're standing still. There will also be health-related technologies 
  in the game such as the &quot;<code>AutoDoc</code>&quot; payload</p>
<h3>Lastly</h3>

<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>You won't find any spawned items such as weapons, ammo, armor or powerups. 
  You start off right away with all the weapons you'll ever have - which are the 
  normal deathmatch weapons up to the hyperblaster (railgun and BFG10K are left 
  out). The <i><b>only</b></i> things that are spawned are the two CDs in the 
  team flagrooms.</p>
<h2>Known Bugs</h2>
<p>This game is <b>not</b> complete - there are quite a few things that need work. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Widgets may be created sticking out of walls</li>
  <li>The balance of various game elements is very rough - basically there need 
    to be adjustments to the energy cost of each item, the speed and potency of 
    various weapons and widget components, and various other game factors relating 
    to timing and scorekeeping.</li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>There will be a <b>huge</b> number of ways technologies can be combined to 
  create widgets, but I'll list a few example combinations here to give you some 
  idea of what's possible.</p>
<h3>Current Technologies</h3>
<p>These are some of the technologies currently implemented in the game:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bodies 
    <ul>
      <li>Box - just sits on the ground, pretty simple</li>
      <li>Body Harness - lets you attach other components to your own body. Has 
        the special feature that any control components show their output on the 
        upper-right of your HUD with direction and range indicators.</li>
      <li>Guided Missile - flies towards whatever spot is specified by a control 
        component (flies in a straight line if no control component is present, 
        or the control hasn't specified a target).</li>
      <li>Standby Missile - like a Guided Missile, but doesn't launch until a 
        target is detected. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Controls 
    <ul>
      <li>Enemy Tracker - tracks the nearest enemy player</li>
      <li>Enemy Carrier Tracker - tracks the nearest enemy player carrying stolen 
        Tech. </li>
      <li>Enemy Widget Tracker - tracks the nearest enemy widget</li>
      <li>Laser Guidance - tracks whatever spot the player's crosshair is resting 
        on, when the fire button is pushed. As a convenience, the Blaster weapon 
        has been replaced with a null-weapon - so that when you select the blaster, 
        you actually have no weapon at all, and can safely press the fire button 
        without actually firing anything and giving your position away</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Payloads 
    <ul>
      <li>AutoDoc - automatically heals nearby team members</li>
      <li>Cluster Bomb - when triggered it throws out a shower of grenades</li>
      <li>Comm Jammer - disrupts enemy team communications originating near the 
        widget</li>
      <li>Echelon Communications Interceptor - eavesdrop on enemy communications</li>
      <li>Energy Siphon - steals energy from enemy players</li>
      <li>Explosive - simple thing that goes &quot;boom!&quot;</li>
      <li>Forcefield - take a wild guess..</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>There will eventually be many more technologies, but that's what I have to 
  start with.</p>
<h4>Example Combinations</h4>
<p>These are just a few example combinations - there are quite a few more that 
  are possible. Not all combinations of components will be useful though - it'll 
  be up to each player to figure out for themselves what works, and what is a 
  waste of energy. </p>
<hr>
<p>Box + AutoDoc = First aid station. The box will simple sit on the ground, and 
  any team member that stands near it will be healed. </p>
<p>Body Harness + AutoDoc = Medic. Team members standing near a player wearing 
  an AutoDoc will be healed.</p>
<p>Box + Cluster Bomb = Remotely triggered bomb. Create a widget like this, then 
  step back and hit the <code>deploy</code> key twice - kaboom!</p>
<p>Box + Enemy Tracker + Cluster Bomb = Automatically triggered bomb. Set one 
  of these up, and it will go off when an enemy player comes near.</p>
<p>Guided Missile + Enemy Tracker + Cluster Bomb = A missile that flies off towards 
  an enemy player, and rains a shower of grenades on his head when it comes close 
  enough.</p>
<p>Guilded Missile + Laser Guidance + Cluster Bomb = A missile that flies towards 
  whatever spot you point your crosshair at while pressing the fire button. If 
  your target is moving, just keep pointing the crosshair at him, and the missile 
  will steer towards him.</p>
<p>Body Harness + Enemy Tracker = Enemy Detector, will show on your HUD the direction 
  and range of a nearby enemy player.</p>
<p>Box + Energy Siphon = More juice for you, if you can sneak this into an area 
  where enemy players tend to congregate.</p>
