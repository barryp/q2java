<h1>Using IBM's Jinsight with Q2Java </h1>
<p><img src="../redline.gif" width="492" height="13"> </p>
<p>Jinsight is a software package <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/Jinsight">available 
  from IBM</a> that contains a specially modified Java Virtual Machine which collects 
  trace information from a running Java program, and a visual tool for analyzing 
  the data. This page will describe how it can be used to trace and analyze <a href="../index.html">Q2Java</a> 
  0.9.1 or later gamecode on the Win32 platform<i> (sorry, the only other version 
  of Jinsight available is for AIX. Linux and Solaris users are SOL</i>).</p>
<p>There's some sort of unfortunate interaction between Q2Java and Jinsight 1.1a 
  that goofs up the keyboard and mouse buttons. Everytime you hit a key or click 
  the mouse - Quake2 acts as if you hit ESC. This somewhat limits what you can 
  test, but by turning freelook off (under the game control options - which you 
  -can- get into) you can at least use the mouse to walk around a level and gather 
  some basic profiling information.</p>
<h2>Configuring Q2Java</h2>
<p>First, you'll need to modify some game code to tell Jinsight when to start 
  tracing. You do this by adding this line somewhere:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="8" align="left" bgcolor="#666666">
  <tr bgcolor="#666666" nowrap> 
    <td> 
      <p><tt>Runtime.getRuntime().traceMethodCalls(true);</tt></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've found that <tt>q2java.baseq2.Player.connect()</tt> is a good place, since 
  it turns tracing on when a player first connects. Calling the same method with 
  a <tt>false</tt> parameter turns tracing off, so if you're only interested in 
  tracing a particular bit of code, you can bracket it with those calls and avoid 
  tracing the entire game. Be sure to recompile after any changes.</p>
<p>Next, you'll need to tell Q2Java to use the Jinsight VM, instead of the standard 
  JDK VM, and the easiest way to do this is in the <tt>q2java.properties</tt> 
  file, with lines like this:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="8" align="left" bgcolor="#666666">
  <tr bgcolor="#666666" nowrap> 
    <td> 
      <p><tt>q2java_vmdll=c:\jinsight1.1\jdk1.1.7-1.1\bin\javai_g.dll<br>
        q2java_jinsight=1</tt></p>
      </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure the path on the <tt>q2java_vmdll</tt> line reflects the Jinsight 
  installation directory on your computer. The <tt>q2java_jinsight</tt> line tells 
  the DLL to avoid doing a few JNI calls that crash the game when Jinsight is 
  the active VM (but the downside is that there will be a small memory leak)</p>
<p>Lastly, you'll need to set a couple environment variables, open a Windows command 
  prompt window and type:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="8" align="left" bgcolor="#666666">
  <tr bgcolor="#666666" nowrap> 
    <td> 
      <p><tt>set JINSIGHT=YES<br>
        set JINSIGHT_TRACEFILE_NAME=c:\q2java.trc</tt></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To tell Jinsight to gather tracing information, and where to store it. If you'd 
  don't set <tt>JINSIGHT=YES</tt>, you'll get a ton of tracing info displayed 
  on the Q2 console, so you've been warned.</p>
<p>Now, we're ready to run. In the same command prompt window that you set those 
  variables, change to the Quake2 directory and type:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="8" align="left" bgcolor="#666666">
  <tr bgcolor="#666666" nowrap> 
    <td> 
      <p><tt>quake2 +set game q2java +map q2dm1</tt></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will start the game and place you in one of the maps. If you placed the 
  <tt>Runtime.getRuntime().traceMethodCalls(true);</tt> statement in the <tt>Player.connect()</tt> 
  method as I suggested above, Jinsight should be furiously collecting data to 
  whatever file you specified in the <tt>JINSIGHT_TRACEFILE_NAME</tt> environment 
  variable. You'll probably only want to run around for a minute or less, since 
  the tracefile gets to be pretty big - several megabytes per minute if you trace 
  the entire game. So you'll have to quit the game after a pretty short time.</p>
<h2>Analyzing your trace</h2>
<p>Now the fun begins. Look in your Jinsight installation directory, you should 
  find a batch file named <tt>jinsight.bat</tt>. It was created when you first 
  installed Jinsight <i>(if you have problems, you might want to check it to be 
  sure it uses the right paths to your plain JDK installation)</i>. If it starts, 
  you should see this window:</p>
<p><img src="Image1.gif" width="400" height="120"></p>
<p>Select <tt>File/Open...</tt> and open your tracefile (<tt>c:\q2java.trc</tt> 
  in the example above). The window should update to show the name of your tracefile, 
  and the <tt>Run</tt> button will no longer be greyed out. Hit Run, and Jinsight 
  will start digesting your trace. It will count the number of events read, and 
  after maybe 20 or 30 seconds, it will stop counting. For the short traces 45-60 
  second traces I've done, I get numbers like 90-100 thousand events.</p>
<p>Now we can start using the stuff under the <tt>Views</tt> menu. One good place 
  to start is with the Histogram. It usually comes up with a histogram of objects, 
  but I think it's more useful to look at the histogram of methods.</p>
<p><img src="Image2.gif" width="561" height="402"></p>
<p>In the window displayed above, I made sure the radio button down in the bottom 
  left labeled <tt>Methods</tt> was checked, then from the menu selected <tt>Options/Recalibrate 
  Colors</tt> and <tt>Options/Sort Class Colors Now</tt>.</p>
<p>This window displays each class on one line, the colors indicating how much 
  time is spent executing that class's methods (Red being more, blue less, purple 
  in the middle). Each box to the right of a class represents an indivdual method, 
  also color-coded, indicating time spent within that particular method. The methods 
  are sorted alphabetically, and when you move the mouse over one, its name is 
  displayed at the bottom of the window.</p>
<p>If all the methods look about the same color, you can select <tt>Options/Decrease 
  Color Scale</tt> from the menu, to make the differences stand out more, and 
  more easily tell which methods withing a class are chewing up CPU cycles.</p>
<h2>Analyzing a method</h2>
<p>The <tt>q2java.baseq2.Player</tt> class is numero uno for time spent executing 
  code, and one of the methods that's almost certainly marked bright red is <tt>playerThink()</tt> 
  - which isn't terribly surprising since it's executed 10 times per-second per-player. 
  Let's take a look at it, by clicking on its box so it's highlighted yellow <i>(you'll 
  probably have to scroll the histogram window to the right to find it)</i>. Then 
  from the main Jinsight window (not the histogram window) select <tt>Views/Invocation 
  Browser</tt>. </p>
<p>A new window will pop up showing a detailed trace of that particular method. 
  The playerThink() method should have executed a whole bunch of times while you 
  were gathering date, and you can use the Previous and Next buttons to look at 
  individual instances - but they should all look about the same. <i>(A few instances 
  will be <b>way</b> longer than others, I think that may be because your machine 
  switched tasks in the middle of the method for a period of time - just use the 
  Previous and Next buttons to look at a few and find one that seems typical.)</i></p>
<p>You'll probably want to stretch your window, use the <tt>Options/Expand Time</tt> 
  or <tt>Options/Compress Time</tt> menu items, or use the mouse to draw a box 
  around a particular area to zoom in on it - so you can see what's going on. 
  With a bit of dinking around you should be able to see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="Image3.gif" width="464" height="668"></p>
<p>Now this is the good stuff! The vertical axis on this chart indicates time, 
  there's a scale over on the right. Each rectangle represents a method, and when 
  a method calls another method, the callee is drawn to the right of the caller. 
  As you move your mouse over the various rectangles, the status bar on the bottom 
  tells you various bits of info like the method name and time. If you click on 
  or to the left of a method, the yellow hightlighting changes to show just that 
  particular method. </p>
<p>In the chart above, you can see that playerThink() calls other methods like 
  <tt>fireEvent()</tt> and <tt>pMove()</tt>. One thing I found alarming was how 
  much time was spent on the <tt>fireEvent()</tt> call, especially since there 
  weren't any listeners registered, and it was basically not doing anything useful. 
  Almost a third of the time spent executing <tt>playerThink()</tt> was completely 
  wasted! This is exactly the kind of thing a program like Jinsight is great for 
  uncovering. </p>
<p>I added a small bit of code to the beginning of <tt>q2java.baseq2.event.PlayerMoveSupport.fireEvent()</tt>: 
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="8" align="left" bgcolor="#666666">
  <tr bgcolor="#666666" nowrap> 
    <td> 
      <p><tt>if (fListeners.size() == 0)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return;</tt></p>
      <p></p>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the game doesn't waste its time cloning events and copying arrays when there's 
  nobody to fire an event off to. After recompiling, and re-tracing, I came up 
  with this:</p>
<p><img src="Image4.gif" width="481" height="590"></p>
<p>Nice! now <tt>fireEvent()</tt> is down to almost nothing and we shaved off 
  about 20% of the execution time from this very important method with just two 
  lines of code added. There are certainly plenty of other places where Q2Java 
  can be tightened up, and with Jinsight they'll be very easy to find.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and Jinsight sure gives you a 
  good picture of what's going on inside a program. It can also display things 
  like memory usage, number of times a method is called, numbers of objects created, 
  and draw diagrams showing which methods are calling each other. </p>
<p>This page just tried to give a taste of using Jinsight. The main distribution 
  comes with much more detailed documentation explaining how the various screens 
  are used, be sure to check it out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the keyboard problem prevents tracing things in the game such 
  as weapons fire, but I hope that can be worked out in a future version of Q2Java 
  and/or Jinsight.</p>
