<h1>Q2Java Overview - Part 2</h1>
This document will attempt to give a broad overview of how the Java classes in 
Q2Java are structured. 
<h2>Packages &amp; Classes &amp; Methods, oh my!</h2>
<p>There are dozens of packages, hundreds of classes and thousands of methods 
  in Q2Java, how do you begin to make sense of all of this? </p>
<p>It might help to compare how Q2Java is structured with how a typical operating 
  system (such as Linux or Windows) is arranged. They have quite a bit in common, 
  and in some ways you can think of Q2Java as a sort of Quake II Game Operating 
  System. </p>

<p>Just as a typical OS has device drivers that allow software to work with underlying 
  hardware, Q2Java's <tt>q2java</tt> package is the interface between Java game 
  software and the underlying Quake II Engine. Device drivers are usually fairly 
  small (at least compared to the kernel and to applications), and the <tt>q2java</tt> 
  package is similarly small, since all it does is provide access to the underlying 
  engine. These classes are the only ones with native methods, everything else 
  in Q2Java is 100% pure Java.</p>
<p>In a typical OS, the kernel is at the heart of things, coordinating interactions 
  between applications and device drivers. The Q2Java equivalents are the classes 
  in the <tt>q2java.core</tt> packages - which manage interactions between gamelets. 
  Just as an OS kernel loads/unloads applications and schedules their execution, 
  the <tt>q2java.core</tt> packages are responsible for loading/unloading gamelets, 
  and controlling when they get a chance to run.</p>
<p>Gamelets are the equivalent of an OS's applications, and just as the whole 
  point of having a kernel and device drivers is so that you can run applications, 
  the reason for the existance of the <tt>q2java</tt> and <tt>q2java.core</tt> 
  packages is to support the running of gamelets. You -have- to run an application 
  on an OS, to do anything useful (even if it's just a command shell). Similarly, 
  Q2Java -has- to run at least one gamelet, otherwise nothing useful will happen.</p>
<h2>Types of Gamelets</h2>
<p>An operating system like Linux or Windows can run a wide variety of applications 
  - spreadsheets, disk utilities, paint programs, you name it. Similarly, there 
  are a whole slew of Q2Java gamelets that can be run in various combinations. 
  To give you some idea of what's possible here are examples of three general 
  types of gamelets currently available for Q2Java.</p>

</table>
<p>That's just a small sample of the gamelets included in Q2Java. Some gamelets, 
  such as <tt>barryp.map.XMLMaps</tt> are totally standalone, and just interact 
  with the <tt>q2java.core</tt> package, while others such as <tt>barryp.rocketmania</tt> 
  interact closely with or are even dependant on other gamelets. </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>So basically, when you're browsing through the Java code in Q2Java, you can 
  figure that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The classes in the <tt>q2java</tt> package (there are only 18 or so), such 
    as <tt>Engine</tt> and <tt>NativeEntity</tt> are there to allow the rest of 
    the Java code to work with the underlying Quake II Engine</li>
  <li>The classes that are in packages that begin with <tt>q2java.core</tt> coordinate 
    the general flow of control between various sections of Java code.</li>
  <li>Everything else is part of a gamelet. Either a gamelet proper (a class that's 
    a subclass of <tt>q2java.core.Gamelet</tt>), or a class that supports a gamelet 
    class. Gamelets and their supporting classes do all the work that actually 
    makes up &quot;a game&quot;- such as weapons firing, flags being captured, 
    gibstats being collected, people running around, chatting, winning, losing, 
    dying, kicking butt and taking names. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are some exceptions and variations, but that's the general scheme of 
  things. </p>
