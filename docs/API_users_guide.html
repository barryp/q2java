Q2Java API Users's Guide v0.4</H1>
These are the JavaDocs for the Q2Java Interface and sample game classes.&nbsp;
There are some gaps in the documentation, but hopefully they'll be filled
in as time goes by.&nbsp; There should be enough here to give a good overview
of the structure of the code.
<H2>
Name Changes</H2>
Since this is pretty much a rewrite of the original Quake II game code,
I took some liberties changing the names of functions and fields.&nbsp;
The Coding Conventions section below lists the stylistic changes made,
but a few other major ones are:
<UL>
<LI>
In the C code, the terms "player", "user", and "client" all mean pretty
much the same thing.&nbsp; The Java code sticks to the term "player", so
the equivalent to the <TT>ClientThink()</TT> function is named <TT>playerThink()</TT>,
and the <TT>usercmd_t</TT> structure's Java equivalent is named <TT>PlayerCmd</TT>,
and so on.</LI>

<LI>
In the C code, the terms "edict" and "entity" seem to mean the same thing.
Q2Java sticks to the term "entity" <I>(according to the dictionary, an
edict is "a proclamation having the force of law" - kind of a strange thing
to call a datastructure)</I></LI>

<LI>
The C <TT>SpawnEntities()</TT> function is renamed to <TT>Game.startLevel()</TT>,
which seemed more descriptive of its actual significance.</LI>

<LI>
Many other C function names have been Java-ized by prefixing the names
with "get" or "set" as in: <TT>getSoundIndex()</TT> instead of <TT>soundindex()</TT>,
and <TT>setConfigString()</TT> instead of <TT>configstring()</TT>.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
Coding Conventions</H2>
The coding conventions used in the Q2Java packages are generally based
on the way Sun does things, with a little bit of Taligent and Netscape
conventions thrown in too.
<UL>
<LI>
Package names are all lowercase, such as: <TT>q2java</TT></LI>

<LI>
Class names begin with an uppercase character, have mixed case and no underscores,
such as: <TT>TraceResults</TT>. <I>(The classes in the <TT>baseq2.spawn</TT>
package are an exception, they're named to match the entity classes found
in maps)</I></LI>

<LI>
Method names begin with a lowercase character, have mixed case and no underscores,
such as: <TT>getPlayerKickAngles()</TT>. <I>(The <TT>Player</TT> class
is an exception, in that methods to handle player commands are all lowercase
and start with <TT>cmd_</TT>)</I></LI>

<LI>
Instance fields begin with a lowercase "<TT>f</TT>", have mixed case and
no underscores, such as <TT>fTargetGroup</TT>.&nbsp; This makes it easy
to distinguish object fields from automatic variables that will go away
when a block is exited.</LI>

<LI>
Static fields begin with a lowercase "<TT>g</TT>", have mixed case and
no underscores, such as: <TT>gGameTime</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
Constants (final statics) are all uppercase, with underscores used to separate
words, such as: <TT>DAMAGE_NO_KNOCKBACK</TT>.</LI>
</UL>
Throughout the code, I used the indentation style where the opening and
closing brackets in a block are both indented, such as:
<PRE>while (true)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foo(a);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bar(b);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</PRE>
I realize that there are other styles more commonly used, but I'd ask that
you don't mix styles within a single file - as Netscape says in their <A HREF="http://developer.netscape.com/library/technote/java/codestyle.html">Java
coding guidelines</A>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>When you pick a style, stick to it.&nbsp; When editing another
person's code, respect the code, copy the style. (When in Rome, do as the
Romans do).</BLOCKQUOTE>
Unfortunately, the overall indentation of the source files is a bit whacked
because I used IBM's VisualAge for Java - and when it exports source code,
it's not so smart about it.&nbsp; Sorry about that - maybe I can get something
to fix it up for later versions.&nbsp;
