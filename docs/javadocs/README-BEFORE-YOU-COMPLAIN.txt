This directory is mostly empty, since there's no real point in
distributing files you can just generate for yourself.

In the directory above this one, there's a batch file named 
"jdocs.bat", which when run, will execute the JavaDoc utility
to fill this directory with all kinds of good info 

(Unix users will need to come up with a similar shell-script).
