  <description>
     Shuffles the positions of weapons around a map at level startup.
     The same number of each type of weapon is retained - so for example
     if a map had one RocketLauncher and two GrenadeLaunchers, it'll still
     have one RL and two GLs, but their positions will be randomly swapped.
