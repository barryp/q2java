  <description>
     Shuffles the positions of weapons around a map at level startup.
     The same number of each type of weapon is retained - so for example
     if a map had one RocketLauncher and two GrenadeLaunchers, it'll still
     have one RL and two GLs, but their positions will be randomly swapped.

  <title>Random Weapons</title>

  <game name="Q2Java"/>
  <description>
     Randomly changes the class of each spawned weapon at level startup.  It might
     be a bit -too- random, in that a map with no BFGs might end up having several.
     Mostly written as a simple demo of how a gamelet can manipulate the DOM document
     that describes a level's initial starting info.

    At level start, this gamelet looks in the level DOM document
    for tags of the form: &lt;gamelet class="xxx" alias="yyy/>, and
    for each one, loads the named gamelet with the specified alias.  
    When the level ends, it unloads these gamelets.  Great for associating
    certain gamelets with certain maps.

  <description>
    At level start, this gamelet looks in the level DOM document
    for tags of the form: &lt;cvar name="xxx" value="yyy/>, and
    for each one, sets the named cvar to the specified value.  When the level
    ends, it restores the changed cvars to their original values.

  <description>
     Prevents BFGs from being spawned, by stripping them out of the 
     DOM document that describes the map at level start time.

  <title>XML Maps</title>
  <author mail="barryp@planetquake.com">Barry Pederson</author>  
  <game name="Q2Java"/>
  <description>
    Attempts to read map information from an external XML file named
    q2java/maps/(mapname).xml - if it can't find one, it creates a new
    XML file based on the info embedded in the maps themselves, and writes
    it to q2java/sandbox/(mapname).xml.  Admins can easily edit those
    XML files and move them to the "maps" directory.

    Prevent players from chatting while underwater by changing their
    messages to "..glub...glub..glub.." (demonstrates print message filtering)
