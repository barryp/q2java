<h1><font face="Arial,Helvetica">SAX COPYRIGHT STATUS</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Version 1.0 of the Simple API for XML (SAX), created
collectively by the membership of the XML-DEV mailing list, is hereby released into the
public domain.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No one owns SAX: you may use it freely in both commercial
and non-commercial applications, bundle it with your software distribution, include it on
a CD-ROM, list the source code in a book, mirror the documentation at your own web site,
or use it in any other way you see fit.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial,Helvetica">NO WARRANTY</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Because SAX is released to the public domain, there is no
warranty for the design or for the software implementation, to the extent permitted by
applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other
parties provide SAX &quot;as is&quot; without warranty of any kind, either expressed or
implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of SAX
is with you. Should SAX prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing,
repair or correction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to
in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or
redistribute SAX, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental
or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use SAX (including but not
limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or
third parties or a failure of the SAX to operate with any other programs), even if such
holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</font></p>
