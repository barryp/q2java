    A change log consists of a release history (releases) with a given name.
    Any number of releases (release) can exist underneath, and in any order.
    Each release specifies a date (GMT field) and version number (free form).
    Each release includes an optional title followed by any number of
    textual descriptions for new features (new), bug fixes (fix), changes and
    updates (change) and obsolete features (dead).
