 * An interface for those objects which wish to be notified when a package is
 * added or removed from a running game.
 * <P>
 * This is useful if packages wants to communicate amongst themselves, or
 * adjust behaviour based on other packages. It also allows package dependencies
 * to be managed. e.g. a package can unload itself if another package has been unloaded
 * thereby minimising some potential runtime errors.
