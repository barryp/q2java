CHANGES from v0.7.0 to v0.8.0

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file will just list changes in the core packages 
(q2java, q2jgame, baseq2, menno.ctf). Add-ons will have to list their own changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DLL CHANGES ===============================================================

    q2java_ConsoleOutputStream.c removed - handled by pure Java now
    
    Several q2java_Engine.c functions renamed so they can be wrapped with
    Java code to make them multithread safe.  
    
    Minor tweaks to javalink_generic.c to allow clean compiles with Kaffe.
    
JAVA CHANGES ==============================================================

q2java.ConsoleOutputStream

    Changed: No longer has any native methods passes output to the Engine
             class, rather than down to the DLL.

q2java.CVar

    Changed: multi-thread safe code added, but commented out

q2java.Engine

    Added:   invokeAndWait() and invokeLater() allow multi-threaded code to 
             submit java.lang.Runnable objects to be executed on the main
             game thread.

             javaConsoleOutput() and setJavaConsoleListener() for handling
             System.out and System.err printing in a thread-safe way.

    Changed: several methods made multithread-safe, all others except multicast(), 
             unicast(), and writeXXX() have multithread code added, but commented out.
             
q2java.GameListener

    Removed: consoleOutput - now comes through the Engine class rather
             than from the DLL             
             
q2java.JavaConsoleListener

    New interface for classes that want to register with Engine to receive
    copies of System.out and System.err output             
             
q2java.NativeEntity

    Added:   getPlayerGravity() - for the sake of completeness.             
             
q2java.ThreadUtility

    New class to help with multithreaded code.             

q2jgame.Game

    Added:   getLocale() to help with LocaleListener management
    
             additional removeLocaleListener() methods to allow objects
             to be removed from single specified locales, rather than all 
             locales.
           
    Changed: Class now implements q2java.JavaConsoleListener.
    
             init() registers the Game object with the Engine class as a
             JavaConsoleListener,
    
             consoleOutput() replaced with javaConsoleOutput()
    
             serverCommand() now prints an error if the user types a command
             in the form of "module.command" and "command" isn't one of the
             commands.offered by "module" - fixing a bug noticed by Withnails.

baseq2.GameObject

    Added:   setGravity() and getGravity() - each object now contains its own
             gravity vector.
             
    Changed: applyGravity() now takes into account an individual object's gravity
             vector, instead of just assuming everything falls downward.
             

baseq2.Player

    Added:   setGravity() overriding GameObject.setGravity() to do extra stuff
             necessary in the case of players.
