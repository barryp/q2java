<font size="+2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b><i>      
        Changes in Q2Java 0.9.7</i></b></font>
<p>
</p>
    
      It's been a long time since the previous version, and this one contains many minor 
      bugfixes and tweaks, along with some big reorganizations that made things cleaner and
      clearer.
    <p>
</p>
    
      The damage event system was reworked to also function for non-Player objects. Everything
      that was named *PlayerDamage* was renamed to just *Damage*.  All fields and methods
      that were geared to the Player class were changed to work for the more
      general GameObject class.   A huge number of classes were affected by these changes
      but for the most part, they were of the search-and-replace type of thing that
      can be fixed in a matter of minutes.  The q2java.baseq2.Player class in particular
      had a slew of "PlayerDamage" fields and methods that were for the most part simply
      renamed.
    <p>
</p>
    
      As part of the damage-system change, all objects had their damage() methods
      replaced with versions that take a single DamageEvent object, instead of a
      slew of parameters.   The GameObject class still has a method for initiating 
      damage with a slew of parameters, but that simply creates a DamageEvent object
	  and passes it on through the new event-system.
    <p>
</p>
    
      The q2java.baseq2.GenericItem class had a nice overhaul, simplifying its internal
      structure greatly, and removing any potential conflicts with its subclasses that
      wanted to receive ServerFrameListener.runFrame() calls (which the old GenericItem class
      also wanted to do).

      Fixed a pretty serious problem in the native implementation of Engine.getRadiusEntities()
	  where if there were more than 32 "hits", you overran a buffer and potentially
      could crash the game.  Even if you don't want to adopt the new Java code in
      this version, at least use the new DLL so you can avoid this problem.

		I messed around with the dropping code a bit, trying to make it a bit
        more realistic when you drop items into water.  I tried to add some
        splashing, slow down the item when it hit the surface, and caused it
        to sink slower when in water.  This changes things a bit from stock Q2, 
        but should be easy to take out if it's a problem.

<font size="-2">Barry</font></font></td><td>
        This class was heavily reworked, making it much easier to understand and maintain.
        Basically, all code relating to time was stripped out and moved to helper classes,
	    such as the DropHelper mentioned above, and some inner classes.  Previously an 
        elaborate finite-state-machine managed a complex system of animations, drop timeouts, 
        and (re)spawning timers - but that's all gone now.  This class no longer implements
        ServerFrameListener, which means that subclasses that implement that interface
        don't have to worry anymore about conflicting with this parent class (the powerups
        such as the Quad and rebreather are examples of those subclasses).

    <tr valign="top">
<td bgcolor="#00aa00"><font color="#ffffff">Added<br>
<font size="-2">Barry</font></font></td><td>
        Added a "droppable" property to the class, with a setDroppable() method.  Previously
        there was an isDroppable() method that always returned true, but was overridden
        by some items such as the plain blaster and CTF grapple.  Now, those classes just
        call setDroppable(false) in their constructors, and don't override isDroppable().  This made it
        easy for a mod to make -all- weapons non-droppable, without having to change each weapon's code.
        (this is one of those improvements where you wonder what the hell you were thinking when
        you wrote the old code).
