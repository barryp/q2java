CHANGES from v0.6.0 to v0.6.1

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file will just list changes in the core packages 
(q2java, q2jgame, baseq2). Add-ons will have to list their own changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DLL CHANGES ===============================================================

q2java_Engine.c

    Added:  support for Engine.getPerformanceCounter() and 
            Engine.getPerformanceFrequency() methods.

game.c

    Added:  built-in performance measuring code for Win32 platforms
            (#ifdefed out for Unix), typing "sv time" will display
            DLL timing as well as Java timing
    
JAVA CHANGES ==============================================================

q2java.Engine

    Added:  getPerformanceCounter() which returns some number of elapsed
            clock ticks, and getPerformanceFrequency() which tells you how
            many clock ticks occur per second on your particular platform.
            
            The number of ticks/second is platform and OS dependent - on my 
            machine I get about 1.2 million ticks/second since the DLL can 
            use the Win32 QueryPerformanceCounter() functions.  Unix will
            fall back to the Standard C Library clock() function, which 
            might only get you 1000 ticks/second.
            
q2jgame.Game

    Changed: runFrame() now uses the Engine.getPerformanceCounter() method
             instead of System.currentTimeMillis() in gathering timing info.
             
             svcmd_time() updated to use values from 
             Engine.getPerformanceCounter(), and 
             Engine.getPerformanceFrequency() in determining average 
             serverframe runtimes.
            
baseq2.Door
baseq2.spawn.func_button
baseq2.spawn.func_door
baseq2.spawn.func_door_rotating
baseq2.spawn.func_door_secret
baseq2.spawn.func_plat
baseq2.spawn.func_rotating
baseq2.spawn.func_train
baseq2.spawn.func_water

    Changed: several getSpawnArg() methods updated to expect float values 
             (fixing problems _Quinn pointed out)
