CHANGES from v0.9.0 to v0.9.1

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file will just list changes in the core packages 
Add-ons will have to list their own changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DLL CHANGES ===============================================================

    Minor tweaks to support Jinsight on Windows and Kaffe on Linux.
    
    Code that constructs player NativeEntity objects changed to do
    it in a less-strange way, to make Kaffe happy.
        
    Debuglog output more clearly indicates which messages came from
    the C code, and which came from Java.    
    
JAVA CHANGES ==============================================================

q2java.Angle3f

    Changed: getVectors() reworked to run a bit faster
    
q2java.NativeEntity

    Changed: Constructors reworked so there is now a private one that
             the C code can call to create player NativeEntity objects,
             rather than having to dink around first allocating an object, 
             setting a field, and -then- calling a constructor (Kaffe 
             didn't like that at all, and it -was- a bit strange)    

q2java.baseq2.Baseq2
    
    Changed: Analysis with Jinsight showed that an awful lot of time was
             being spent reading the same CVars over and over again.
             Added code to BaseQ2 to mirror the CVars every 10 seconds
             in some static floats, which can be quickly be accessed by
             interested Java code.
             
             Several other classes were changed to read these floats 
             instead of reading the CVars.
             
q2java.baseq2.MiscUtil

    Removed: parseAngle3f(), parsePoint3f(), and stuffCommand() moved to
             q2java.core.GameUtil, since the were useful to more than 
             just the baseq2 gamelet.
                          
                          
q2java.baseq2.Player

    Changed: calcRoll() and calcViewOffset() optimized a bit thanks to Jinsight  
    
    
q2java.baseq2.event.PlayerMoveSupport

    Changed: fireEvent() now returns early if no listeners are registered.    
    
    
q2java.core.event.EventPack

    Changed: fireEvent() sped up, thanks to Jinsight.
