CHANGES from v0.5.2 to v0.5.3

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file will just list changes in the core packages 
(q2java, q2jgame, baseq2). Add-ons will have to list their own changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DLL CHANGES ===============================================================
       
    No changes to the DLL, but Gorilla's <gorilla@pro-ns.net> supposedly 
    working Solaris SPARC port and Bernd Kreimeier's <bk@gamers.org> beginnings 
    of a Linux port are now included.
    
    
JAVA CHANGES ==============================================================

q2java.Q2JavaSecurityManager

    Changed: Tightened up the checkRead(String) method: found that you can
             find the JDK home directory using System.getProperty("java.home").
             
             
q2jgame.DefaultClassFactory

    Changed: addModule method now catches InvocationTargetExceptions 
             separately and prints the target exception rather than the              
             InvocationTargetException itself.

baseq2.AmmoPack

    Renamed to InventoryPack and generalized to handle more than just Ammo
    
baseq2.GenericItem    

    Added:   abstract methods: getIconName(), getItemName(), getModelName will
             need to be implemented by all subclasses
    
             getPickupSound() - to indicate what sound to play when the item
             is picked up.  GenericItem supplies a default sound that 
             subclasses can override
             
    Changed: touch() method no longer directly flashes the player's screen, 
             instead it calls the new Player.notifyPickup() method.
             
baseq2.GenericAmmo
baseq2.GenericArmor

    Added: getPickupSound() - overrides GenericItem.getPickupSound()
             
baseq2.GenericHealth

    Added: getItemName() and getIconName - implement abstract methods 
           in GenericItem          
           
baseq2.GenericWeapon

    Removed: getWeaponName() - that info is now supplied by getItemName()   
    
             getIconName() - that info is now supplied by each weapon class
               separately 
    
    Added:   getPickupSound() - overrides GenericItem.getPickupSound()
    
    Changed: touch() no longer prints a message on the player's screen when
             they pickup a weapon - the GenericItem.touch() takes care of
             notifying the player by calling Player.notifyPickup()        
             
baseq2.InventoryList

    New class supplied by Brian Haskin - to keep a list of items that may be
    displayed on a player's inventory screen.  Also supplies string indexes
    for displaying pickup messages on the HUD.        
    
baseq2.InventoryTracker
    
    New class supplied by Brian Haskin to track a player's inventory counts, 
    but modified to also track Ammo info and Weapon objects.
    
baseq2.Player

    Added:    closeDisplay() method closes special screens like scores and 
              inventory (Brian Haskin)
              
              cmd_inven() method implements the player "inven" command which
              displays a inventory screen (Brian Haskin)
    
              notifyPickup() method handles flashing the player's screen when
              they pick something up, and displays the name and icon of the 
              item on the HUD.
              
              removeInventory() removes an item from the player's 
              InventoryTracker (used in CTF)

    Changed:  Now uses a single InventoryTracker object to track weapons and 
              ammo, instead of separate ammo-belt, weapon-list, and inventory 
              objects.  Many methods had minor alterations to support the new
              inventory scheme.
              
              cmd_putaway() and spawn() now uses the more general closeDisplay() 
              method (Brian Haskin)
              
              worldEffects() now implements drowning in water, choking on slime
              and frying in Lava.
              
baseq2.WelcomeMessage

    Changed:  Now includes VM and OS information to show connecting players.              
        
        
baseq2.ammo_*
baseq2.item_armor_*
baseq2.item_health_*
baseq2.weapon_*      

    All these classes were updated to implement/override all or some of the 
    new GenericItem methods: getItemName(), getIconName(), getModelName(), and
    getPickupSound().
