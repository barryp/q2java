    Description: Sourcecode to the Q2Java v0.2 DLL

    Requirements: To recompile, you'll need a C compiler and a
                  Java Development kit that includes
                  JNI (Java Native Interface) support.
                  (Under Windows, this would be Sun's JDK 1.1.5)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
The DLL sourcecode should be fairly standard ANSI C, except for
the "javalink.c" file which contains all the platform-specific
code.

Porting Q2Java to other platforms that support Quake II, Java,  and
the JNI should just be a matter of rewriting the "javalink.c"
for that particular platform and recompiling.

            -------------------------

Feel free to fool with it all you want, but if you find the need
to make additions or changes, please try to refrain from
distributing slightly incompatible versions.  Instead, please
share your suggestions or requests with me or on the JavaQuake
mailing list - and hopefully we can have a "standard" Java DLL
that people can write their Java games to, rather than having to
choose one particular variation or another.
