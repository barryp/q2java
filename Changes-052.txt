CHANGES from v0.5.1 to v0.5.2

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file will just list changes in the core packages 
(q2java, q2jgame, baseq2). Add-ons will have to list their own changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DLL CHANGES ===============================================================
       
q2java_NativeEntity.c

    Changed: Fixed minor problem with the copySettings0() function that
             kept it from actually working.
    
    

JAVA CHANGES ==============================================================

q2java.NativeEntity

    Changed: Updated EV_* constants to match the 3.14 sourcecode (that's
             what was messing up the teleport effect)
             
        	 EV_MALE_FALL, EV_MALE_FALLFAR, EV_FEMALE_FALL, EV_FEMALE_FALLFAR
        	 were removed and replaced with just EV_FALL and EV_FALLFAR, which
        	 changed the value of EV_PLAYER_TELEPORT
             

q2jgame.DefaultClassFactory

    Changed: The class is now public 
    
             Notification of additions and removals now handled by parent 
             class.
             
q2jgame.Game

    Added:   getClassFactory() - retrieves the current class factory

    Changed: externalServerCommand() now prints a more specific error message
             when you try to run a svcmd on a non-existant module (thanks Quinn)             
             
             startLevel() now clears listeners and spawns new entities before
             notifying other interested objects that a new level is starting
             (it used to be that the notification happened before clearing and
             spawning)
             
q2jgame.GameClassFactory

    Added:   notify() method - probably so all class factories can use it.
                

baseq2.BfgBlast

    Changed: Fixed BFG so that it does the same amount of damage as in the     
             C game.  Turned out that in part of the explosion damage 
             calculation, the formula was referring to "fEntity" (the 
             entity of the bfg blast itself) instead of "victim.fEntity" 
             (the entity of the player being hit) - so when the damage 
             formula was taking the distance into account, it was always 
             coming up with a distance of zero (distance from bfgblast to 
             bfgblast) and giving the player total damage instead of coming 
             up with the real distance (distance from bfgblast to player) 
             and decreasing the damage if the player was farther away from 
             the blast.

baseq2.Corpse 
baseq2.CorpseQueue

    Added these classes to track corpses lying around the map

baseq2.GameModule

    Added:   copyCorpse() method to copy a player's corpse to another entity
             when they respawn.

baseq2.GenericWeapon

    Changed: touch() method now prints pick-up message on screen, rather
             than the Player.addWeapon() method

baseq2.Player

    Added:   getArmorCount(), setArmorCount(), getArmorMaxCount(),  
             setArmorMaxCount(), getHealthMax(), setHealthMax(), 
             isFemale(), for CTF support
             
             welcome() method - handles welcoming and announcing the player
             into the game..used to be handled by playerBegin() but is now
             separate so that mods like CTF can easily override that behavior.

    Changed: addAmmo() method now does nothing when called with a null ammoType
    
             addWeapon() methods now take a second, boolean, parameter that
             indicates if auto-switching to the new weapon is desired.
             
             alterAmmoCount() was renamed to setAmmoCount() and a second, 
             boolean, parameter was added to indicate whether the value
             being set was an absolute value, or a relative one that
             should be added to the existing ammo count.
             
             damage() method now causes blood to spray when shooting a dead body
             
             die() method to use the CorpseQueue, also dead bodies aren't
             SOLID_NOT anymore and can be shot to give off blood (and gib
             in the future)             
             
             playerBegin() now calls welcome() to announce the player's 
             entrance into the game.
                                       
             fScore, fArmorCount, fArmorMaxCount fields are now private, 
             use get/set methods to access them.
             
baseq2.spawn.weapon_*

    Changed: All weapons had their fire() method updated to use 
             Player.setAmmoCount instead of the old alterAmmoCount().
