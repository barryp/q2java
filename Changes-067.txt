JAVA CHANGES ==============================================================

q2java.gui.IconCountdownTimer

    New class from Brian Haskin - implements a widget that displays an
    icon and counts down to zero by itself - used by the quad
    
q2java.gui.IconIntegerDisplay

    New class from Brian Haskin - displays an icon and an integer, 
    superclass of IconCountdownTimer

menno.ctf.GenericFlag

    Changed: Reworked so that -all- flag behavior is now encapsulated in this
             class, instead of the Player class.  This includes flags being
             picked up, dropped, captured, returned, altering player effects,
             and so on.
             
menno.ctf.GenericTech

    Changed: Reworked so that almost all remaining tech behaviors are now
             implemented in this class instead of the Player class - including
             how items are picked up and dropped.
                 
menno.ctf.Player

    Removed: addFlag(), addItem(), addTech(), cmd_drop(), dropFlag(), 
             dropTech(), dropInventory(), die() - no longer needed
             since the baseq2.Player, GenericFlag, and GenericTech
             classes are now smart enough to take care of all those
             functions themselves.
             
    Added:   playerBegin() - overrides baseq2.Player.playerBegin() so
             we can tell when levels start - so the right spawnpoints 
             can be chosen.
                          
    Changed: getSpawnpoint() altered so that players spawn inside their base
             only the first time each level.                                 
             
             cmd_chasecam, cmd_team(), cmd_spectator(), and dispose() - 
             simplified now that techs, flags , and teams are smart enough 
             to deal with players changing teams or disconnecting.
             
menno.ctf.Team

    Added:   playerStateChanged() - so the Team can deal with players
             disconnecting.
             
    Changed: addPlayer() and removePlayer() altered to register/deregister
             the team to be notified if the player disconnects             
             
menno.ctf.spawn.item_tech*

    Changed: various methods altered to use getOwner() instead of
             accessing the fOwner field directly.
                 
menno.ctf.spawn.weapon_grapple

    Added:   playerStateChanged() - so the grapple can deal with players
             dying, disconnecting, or changing levels itself.    
             
baseq2.GenericBlaster

    Changed: fire() method takes damage multiplier into account (Brian Haskin)                      
    
baseq2.GenericItem

    Added:   getRespawnTime() - to find out how long to wait before 
             respawning an item (Brian Haskin)
             
    Changed: touchFinish() extra parameter added to pass a reference
             to the item that was taken.
             
             touch() - passes extra parameter to touchFinish() and 
             uses value from getRespawnTime() instead of using fixed
             value for all items.
             
baseq2.GenericPowerUp

    New class from Brian Haskin - superclass for quad and other powerups
    down the road sometime
    
baseq2.GenericWeapon

    Changed: now implements PlayerStateListener
    
             activate()/deactivate() - registers weapon to be called if
             the player dies, disconnects, changes levels.
    
    Added:   playerStateChanged() - weapons now deal with players dying
             or disconnecting themselves.                    
             
baseq2.InventoryTracker

    Changed: get() altered to fix grenade count bug (Brian Haskin)  
    
baseq2.Player

    Added:   addPlayerStateListener(), removePlayerStateListener(),                          
             notifyPlayerStateListeners() - to let interested objects
             know when players die, change levels, or disconnect.
             
             getInventoryCount() - to find out how many of any given
             item a player is carrying.
             
             resetBlend() - clears the current screen blend (Brian Haskin)
             
    Changed: addItem() now returns true if it doesn't recognize the 
             class of the item being added - basically assuming the 
             item itself knows what to do to the player. 
             
             beginServerFrame() - resets blend at start of method,
             to support the quad (Brian Haskin)       
             
             calcBlend() - no longer resets the blend
             
             cmd_use() - altered to allow other items such as quad to
             be used (Brian Haskin)
             
             die() - no longer tries to drop the player's inventory, 
             but instead calls notifyPlayerStateListeners() so that
             interested items like weapons can drop themselves.
             
             dispose(), playerBegin(), startIntermission() - call 
             notifyPlayerStateListeners() to notify interested objects that 
             the player is disconnecting or changing levels. Very handy for 
             things like CTF flags, techs, and teams.
             
             spawn() - now calls killbox() to implement telefragging.
             
    Removed: dropInventory() - items are now smart enough to drop
             themselves when players die or disconnect         
             
baseq2.PlayerStateListener

    New interface for objects that want to be called by players when
    they die, disconnect, or change levels.  Useful for things like 
    weapons, CTF flags, techs, etc.
    
baseq2.spawn.ammo_grenades
    
    Added: getDefaultAmmoCount() returns 5 (Brian Haskin)

             (Brian Haskin)                               
    
baseq2.spawn.weapon_machinegun

    Changed: fire() method no longer causes weapon to rise while in DM.    
             (Brian Haskin)
    
baseq2.spawn.weapon_rocketlauncher

    Changed: getDefaultAmmoCount returns 5 instead of 10 (Brian Haskin)
