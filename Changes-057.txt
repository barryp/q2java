JAVA CHANGES ==============================================================

q2jgame.Game

    Changed: startLevel() now makes a second call to objects registered
             as LevelListeners, notifying them that level entities have been
             spawned.
             
q2jgame.LevelListeners

    Added:   levelEntitiesSpawned() method that will be called when a new
             map has been started, after map entities have been spawned.
             
             
baseq2.GameModule

    Added:   do-nothing levelEntitiesSpawned() method to satisfy the 
             LevelListeners interface.       
             
baseq2.MiscUtil

    Added:   killBox() method, kills everything within a certain box, used
             by baseq2.spawn.func_wall, and baseq2.spawn.func_killbox
             
baseq2.Player

    Added:   do-nothing cmd_invuse(), cmd_invnext(), and cmd_invprev() methods
             to make things smoother for CTF and NWRA that use those methods
             for player menu handling, and will need to call these superclass
             methods when a menu isn't being displayed.  Someday we'll actually
             put code in these methods, but for now CTF and NWRA will be able to
             call them.                                              

    Changed: endServerFrame() now calls worldEffects() a little sooner, to match
             what the C game does.
             
             showVWep now does nothing when the player is dead.
             
             obituary Resource Bundles are now individual for each player
             
             the die() method handles calling obituary() for each player, 
             announcing who died
             
             obituary() now is called for each player individually when someone
             dies, do the death message can be formatted for  the individual 
             player's locale.
             
             applyPlayerInfo() looks for a CVAR named "locale", to set the 
             players obituary resource bundle locale.
             
baseq2.spawn.func_killbox

    New class added - not sure what maps it occurs in.
    
baseq2.spawn.func_wall

    Changed: should now only kill players in the way, rather than every player 
             that's connected.
