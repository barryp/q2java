Q2JAVA EXTRAS

The Q2Java distribution includes a few extra goodies intended to 
demonstrate various interesting things programming in Java allows.  They 
are implemented as game modules you can load either at startup on the 
command line with a command like: 

    quake2 +set game q2java +set q2jgame_modules <module>+baseq2
    
or in some cases while the game is running with a console command like:

    sv addmodule <module> [<alias-name>]
    
The <module>'s are:

    barryp.autoload

        Simple module that automatically exec's a file named "autoload.cfg" 
        as soon as possible once the game is running.  Great for loading 
        other modules like barryp.telnet.   
        
        For example, on my test server, I have a batch file that loads 
        Q2Java with the parameter: 
        
            +set q2jgame_modules barryp.autoload+baseq2
            
        and have a file named "autoload.cfg" that looks something like 
        this:    
        
            sv addmodule barryp.telnet telnet 
            sv telnet.start 1100 -nocmd 
            sv telnet.log on 
            set timelimit 15 
            gamemap q2dm1

        so that after the game has started, the "barryp.telnet" module is 
        loaded with the alias "telnet", then the "telnet" module is given a 
        few commands to start listening to port 1100 and to start logging 
        connections.  Finally the timelimit CVAR is set, and the map is set 
        to q2dm1.

    barryp.bountyhunters
    
        Changes the rules of DM so that players are assigned particular
        victims.  A Direction indicator and Range indicator help in
        finding your target, and a flashing crosshair helps confirm you're
        aiming at the right guy.  The complication is that while you're
        hunting a particular player, someone is hunting -you-.  You get
        points for killing your assigned victim or your stalker, and lose
        points for killing innocent victims.        
        
    barryp.flashgrenade
    
        Replaces the baseq2.HandGrenade class to add the extra behavior
        of temporarily blinding enemies if they're looking in the direction 
        of the explosion.        

    barryp.paranoia
    
        Changes the rules of DM so that players are paired off, one
        is assigned as a stalker, the other as a paranoid victim.  
        A Direction indicator helps the stalker find his victim and a 
        flashing crosshair helps confirm they're aiming at the right guy.
        A Range indicator give the victim a sense of how close his stalker is.
        You get points for killing your assigned victim or your stalker, 
        and lose points for killing innocent victims.  Players that aren't
        paired off with another player are "loose cannons", and can kill or
        be killed by anyone for a smaller number of points.
               
    barryp.persist
    
        After this module is loaded, any player that connects is a 
        "persistant" player - meaning that when they quit, their settings 
        (including weapons, ammo, current health, etc.) are saved in a file 
        (in the sandbox directory), and when they reconnect - their 
        settings are automatically restored.   (Being able to store and 
        retrieve a player's state is the first step towards multiserver 
        clustering)

    barryp.rocketmania

        Demonstrates replacement of the basic games weapons.  Includes a 
        blaster with that fires small rockets, a machinegun that fires 
        rockets as well as bullets, and a rocketlauncher that fires more 
        powerful rockets.

    barryp.telnet

        Allows telnet or MUD clients to act as remote consoles. (usage is         
        covered in the main q2java05.txt file)

    barryp.testbot

        A very very very simple bot that just stands where it's spawned, 
        but it demonstrates subclassing the baseq2.Player class to create 
        somthing that looks and mostly acts like a player, even though 
        nobody's actually controlling it though a Q2 client program.

        You have to be running Quake2 in server mode (as opposed to         
        single-player mode) in order to spawn bots.  Once the game is 
        started, drop down the console and type something like:

            sv addmodule barryp.testbot fred             sv.addmodule 
            barryp.testbot barney

        to create a bots named "fred" and "barney".  They will be standing         
        on map spawnpoints (finding them bot can be a pain on some maps), 
        and you can issue some commands to them like:

            sv barney.help      // gets barney's current status             
            sv fred.skin <skin> // changes the bot's skin, try something like 
                                   "female/athena" to give fred a new look.

            sv fred.cmd <command>  // cause the bot to execute a                                       
                                      player-command                                  

            sv fred.locale         // will tell you what locale fred uses                                       
                                      when speaking

            sv fred.locals <new-locale> // changes fred's locale

        The locales are strings that are either:

            "<language-code>" or "<language-code>_<country-code>" or             
            "<language-code>_<country-code>_<variant>"

        The language codes are two-letter ISO language codes, such as "en"         
        for english and "fr" for french.  The country codes are two-letter 
        ISO country codes like "US" for the United States, "CA" for Canada, 
        "FR" for France and so on. The variants are user-defined.  So, a 
        bot might have its locale set to things like:
        
            en                - English in general
            en_US             - English as spoken in the U.S.
            en_US_surferdude  - Surfer Dude variant of U.S. English
            en_CA             - English as spoken in Canada
            fr                - French in general
            fr_CA             - French Canadian
            fr_FR             - French as spoken in France
            
        Anyhow, the bot doesn't actually speak all those languages, but 
        they could be easily added - look in the 
        <gamedir>\classes\barryp\testbot directory for the files named 
        talk*.properties to see which locales are currently supported, and 
        feel free to create your own.            
        
        To cause the bot to speak, injure it (although you have to aim 
        somewhere above the head to hit it - there's a bug there)
