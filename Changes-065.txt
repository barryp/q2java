JAVA CHANGES ==============================================================

javax.vecmath.*

    Changed: Kenji Hiranabe updated his implementation of this package, his
             current version is: 1.1-1.6
    
    
baseq2.BlasterBolt

    Changed: Rewritten to be more like the C equivalent, but unfortunately
             it doesn't yet fix the bug where firing at things close by doesn't 
             work correctly.      
    
    
baseq2.GenericWeapon

    Added:   getDefaultAmmoCount() - indicates how much ammo this type of
             weapon normally starts off with.

    Changed: constructors use getDefaultAmmoCount() to initialize the weapon's
             ammo.
             
             
baseq2.Player

    Changed: clearSettings() sets weapon fields to null..fixing bug introduced 
             in 0.6.4 where weapons stopped working when the level changed.
             
             dropInventory() drops weapons with default amounts of ammo like
             in Q2, instead of whatever the player was carrying like in QW.
             
baseq2.spawn.ammo_grenades

    Changed: hand-held grenades make correct sounds, and weapon switch occurs 
             now when grenades run out (provided by James Bielby)       
             
baseq2.spawn.weapon_*

    Added:   getDefaultAmmoCount() as required by baseq2.GenericWeapon
    
    Changed: setFields() no longer fools with setting default ammo count
