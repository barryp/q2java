This archive contains the following files:

gamesparc.so		The Solaris shared library.
Makefile		The Makefile used to compile and link the library
javalink_Solaris.c	The Solaris-specific code for the shared library.
warnings.txt		A list of warning generated at compile time.
readme.solaris		This ever-so-informative-self-referenced file.

The Makefile defines the following targets:

clean:	 Removes the object files and the library.
all:	 Compiles the source files (as needed) and links the library.
install: Moves the shared library up one directory (where it needs
	 to be in order to run the Solaris dedicated Q2 server).
tar:	 Automate creation of the tar file.

Questions on the port can be addressed to gorilla@pro-ns.net. If 
someone has done or is doing a Linux port, contact me. With a small
amount of effort, we can get this process to work seamlessly on both
platforms.

Changelog
=========
0.52
 - Minor changes to the Makefile. No changes to C code.

0.51 Initial port

To Do
=====
 - Clean up warnings. See warnings.txt for a complete list. Minor
   nitpick, but a good habit to acquire.
 - Replace the C++ comments (//) with C-style comments (/* blah */).
   The Solaris compiler has a flag to allow C++ comments in C code.
   Does the Linux compiler (gcc) also allow this? If so, we don't
   have to worry about it.
 - Thoroughly test the Solaris server w/ q2java.
