                  Quake II CTF 1.0 or higher (only the pak0.pak)

-------------------------------------


INSTALLING

    First, you need to get Q2Java working, see details in Q2Java zip-file.

    Secondly, you and your players need to move the pak0.pak from the CTF 
    directory to your baseq2 directory, so that games other than CTF can find it. 
    There is probably already a file called pak0.pak, but you can give any *.pak 
    another name: pak?.pak, where ? ranges from 0 to 9.

    Then copy the classes directory from this zip-file into your classpath, 
    assuming you already have a "/q2java/classes" directory, you can copy it 
    into that directory. The directory-tree should look like this now:

                                 /quake2
                                    |
                ---------------------
                |                   |        
             /baseq2             /q2java   
                |                   |
          <CTF .pak file>           |
                                 /classes  
                                    |
                    ---------------------------------------
                    |       |       |      |       |      |
                 /barryp /baseq2 /javax /menno /q2java /q2jgame


You can start the CTF game with this command:

  quake2 +set game q2java +set q2jgame_packages menno.ctf+baseq2 +map q2ctf1
  
If a game has already started, you can switch from DM to CTF  
with these console commands:

    sv addmodulelater menno.ctf
    sv changemap q2ctf1
    
To switch from CTF back to DM:    

    sv removemodulelater menno.ctf
    sv changemap q2dm1

Happy Capturing !!!
