JAVA CHANGES ==============================================================


q2jgame.Game

    Added:   getVWepIndex() - tracks VWep Indexes, to support the VWep features 
             added to Quake2 3.15
             
             svcmd_addmodulelater() and svcmd_removemodulelater() allow an admin
             to schedule module addition or removal to happen at the moment a
             map changes.  Makes switching modules like CTF in and out very
             seamless to the players.
             
             svcmd_help() shows modules that will be removed or added 
             at the next map change.
           
    Changed: addLocaleListener() no longer removes an object if it was already
             registered to receive localecast messages.  This way an object 
             can register for multiple locales. However, if an object doesn't 
             want to receive multiple versions of messages, it has to take 
             care of removing itself when switching locales.
             
             spawnEntities() now uses the JDK 1.1 java.io.PrintWriter class, 
             instead of the depricated JDK 1.0 java.io.PrintStream class.

             startLevel() was modified to support VWep index tracking, and
             deferred module adding and removal.
             
q2jgame.LocaleListener

    Changed: localecast() method now includes the locale the message is 
             formatted for.  Useful for objects that want to register to
             receive messages formatted for multiple locales.  Objects that
             only are registered for a single locale will probably just ignore
             this parameter.
             
q2jgame.ResourceGroup

    Changed: localecast() methods modified to send the locale as a parameter
    
             removeLocaleListener() made public, so objects can more easily
             remove themselves.
             
baseq2.GameModule

    Removed: isVWepOn() and svcmd_vwep() - no longer needed because of the 
             new-style VWep support
             
    Added:   svcmd_changemap() - allows an admin to make graceful map 
             switches from the console, so that players see an intermission 
             w/scoreboard.  
             
    Changed: runFrame(), startLevel(), and timeToQuit() modified to support 
             graceful map changes.                                                         
             
             
baseq2.GenericItem

    Changed: runFrame() altered so that for a group (team) of items, only
             one if spawned at a time.  Fixes BFG/Hyperblaster bug in base1
             and BFG/Railgun bug in q2dm2. (James Bielby)
             
baseq2.GenericWeapon

    Added:   getVWepIndex() and precacheVWepIndex() for the new-style
             VWep support.    
             
             getWeaponSound() - lets weapons like the BFG and Railgun
             specify a sound to emit when wielded.  Other weapons just
             return null.    
             
baseq2.MiscUtil

    Changed: getSpawnpointSingle() - fix minor bug found by Bernd Kreimeier                  
    
baseq2.Player

    Added:   calcClientSound() causes weapons like the BFG and Railgun to 
             give off sounds when wielded. (James Bielby)

    Changed: one line was moved from playerThink() to endServerFrame() to fix
             the "no-damage-when-falling" bug.   
             
             endServerFrame() calls the new calcClientSound()
             
             localecast() modified to take the locale as a parameter 
             
             Player() <the constructor> modified to precache the hand-blaster
             VWep model
             
             playerVariableChanged() removes the Player from an old locale
             before registering for a new one.
             
             setAnimation() no longer worries about VWep since it's on all 
             the time now.
             
             showVWep() greatly simplified to support the new-style VWep.
             
baseq2.spawn.target_speaker

    Changed: fixed so that ambient noises now work, thanks to James Bielby 
    
baseq2.spawn.target_splash
baseq2.spawn.target_temp_entity

    New map entity classes supplied by James Bielby   
    
baseq2.spawn.weapon_bfg
baseq2.spawn.weapon_railgun

    Changed: now specify the sounds they emit. (James Bielby)
