No changes this week       
    
JAVA CHANGES ==============================================================

q2jgame.Game

    Changed: spawnEntities() now writes out a "entities.log" to the sandbox 
             directory containing the current map's entString, and a list of 
             Java objects created to implement the map entities - to help with 
             debugging.
             
             fixed typo in svcmd_help() (menory -> memory)
             
baseq2.Door
    
    Changed: reworked to support the DOOR_TOGGLE option, and to function 
             correctly when doors are teamed (fixes bug on q2dm6 with 
             spastic slanted doors)             
             
baseq2.FixedObject

    New interface to mark game object classes that are fixed in place and 
    shouldn't be moved by lifts and such.             
             
baseq2.GameModule

    Changed: startIntermission() now does nothing if already in intermission             
             
baseq2.GameObject

    Changed: dispose() makes sure fEntity is not null before trying to free it
    
             useTargets() makes sure object in list implements GameTarget, 
             prints an error message otherwise.    
             
baseq2.GenericPusher

    Removed: getMoveDir() - method renamed to calcMoveDir() and moved to 
             baseq2.MiscUtil
             
    Changed: now implements FixedObject
    
             push() - now avoids pushing things that implement the 
             "FixedObject" marker interface               

baseq2.GenericSpawnpoint

    Changed: now implements FixedObject - fixes bug in q2ctf3 where spawnpad
             near red lift was being pushed up into the air.

baseq2.MiscUtil

    Added:   calcMoveDir() - relocated from baseq2.GenericPusher, was useful
             for classes other than subclasses to GenericPusher

baseq2.PlatformTrigger

    Changed: now implements FixedObject

baseq2.Player

    Added:   cmd_iddebug() - identifies GameObject in crosshairs, useful for
             tracking down problems with doors, lifts, etc.  Unfortunately
             doesn't work with items that are picked up like ammo and weapons.
             
    Changed: addWeapon() lets you pick up a type of weapon more than once and
             have that reflected in the inventory count, although there's not 
             much point in this until the ability to drop weapons is added.
    
             damage() no longer sprays blood after someone dies - fixes problem
             with blood-spray in lava after death for now - although it may 
             be better to just avoid checking for lava damage to dead players
             in worldEffects().
             
             startIntermission() - sets the player's groundEntity to null, so 
             you don't move during intermission if you happened
             to be on a lift, conveyer, or some other moving object when it hit.
             
baseq2.Trigger

    New class to be superclass for baseq2.spawn.trigger_always and 
    baseq2.spawn.trigger_relay             
             
baseq2.WelcomeMessage

    Changed: default welcome message now includes current time on server
    
baseq2.spawn.ammo_rockets

    Changed: getIconName() now returns correct icon for rockets 
    
baseq2.spawn.func_button

    Changed: reworked so that buttons properly reset after being used       
    
baseq2.spawn.func_door

    Changed: calls MiscUtil.calcMoveDir() instead of old 
             GenericObject.getMoveDir()      
             
baseq2.spawn.func_timer

    Changed: wasn't declared as implementing GameTarget, causing some things
             not to function properly.      
             
baseq2.spawn.func_water

    New class..implements water/lava that rises and falls. Things like the 
    FragPipe in q2dm3 now work.
    
baseq2.spawn.light

    Changed: reworked, so that targeted lights now are supported, haven't really
             tested them though.   
             
baseq2.spawn.target_changelevel

    Changed: actually works now - in single player mode it lets you move from
             map to map just like the real game.  Disabled in DM mode.             
             
baseq2.spawn.trigger_always
baseq2.spawn.trigger_relay

    Changed: made subclasses of baseq2.Trigger             
             
baseq2.spawn.trigger_multiple
baseq2.spawn.trigger_once

    New classes - cause many more map features to work such as rotating ramp
    in q2dm6, and single-player sound effects in maps like base1 that occur
    when you step past certain points.
