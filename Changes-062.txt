CHANGES from v0.6.1 to v0.6.2

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file will just list changes in the core packages 
(q2java, q2jgame, baseq2). Add-ons will have to list their own changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DLL CHANGES ===============================================================

javalink_generic.c

    No changes to the actual code, but an #ifdef was added around the 
    "#include <direct.h>" line to make Solaris compile more cleanly.
    
JAVA CHANGES ==============================================================

javax.vecmath.*

    Updated this package with the latest version from Kenji Hiranabe. There
    weren't any changes that affected Q2Java, but I figured it'd be good
    to keep it up-to-date.

q2jgame.Game

    Changed: svcmd_javagc() now displays how long the GC took to run.
            
baseq2.Player

    Added:   new knockback() method split off from the damage() method, 
             should make it easier to support rocket-jumping on NWRA.
