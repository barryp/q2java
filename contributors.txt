Q2JAVA CONTRIBUTORS

Quite a few people have participated in the development of Q2Java with 
testing and suggestions, but I especially want to note those who actually
contributed Java or C code that's been incorporated in the game.

My apologies if I've overlooked anyone, and thanks to everyone who's

encouragement.
